        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol><strong>Pasta</strong> What I love about this garlic chicken pasta recipe is you can literally use any kind of pasta that you like. I typically alter my recipe, depending on what kind of pasta I found on sale.</ol>
            <ol><strong>olive oil</strong> You want a good quality olive oil to cook the chicken in.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Tomatoes</strong> The tomatoes enhance the way the chicken pasta looks, but it also makes it</ol>
            <ol><strong>Butter</strong> The butter helps cook the garlic and adds to the flavor.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Garlic</strong> For best results, use minced garlic. I stick around to four cloves for this recipe, but you could always add in more or less depending on what you like.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Heavy cream</strong> The real star of the show is the heavy cream! It gives this chicken pasta a creamy texture that is crave-worthy.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Spinach</strong> Spinach gives you a boost in vitamins and minerals. You can leave it out if you want to, but I love the flavor.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong> You can't really have an Italian dish without some Parmesan cheese, right?</ol>
            <ol><strong>Chicken</strong> I typically use boneless skinless chicken breast; you could also use boneless skinless chicken thighs. It's entirely up to you, and whatever you prefer will be fine.</ol>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water in a large pot and add salt to the boiling water. This will help season the pasta as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package until it reaches your desired level of tenderness. Drain the pasta once it's cooked.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the other ingredients. Chop the tomatoes, mince the garlic, and slice the chicken into small, bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic to the pan and saut√© until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the pan and cook until it's no longer pink in the center. Make sure it's cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook for a few minutes until they soften and release their juices.</li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream and stir well. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes, allowing it to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta to the sauce. Toss everything together to ensure the pasta is well coated with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the pasta and toss again to combine all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
