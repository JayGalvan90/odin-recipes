    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Quaerat provident pariatur soluta.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>Granny Smith apples</ol>
        <ol>Flour</ol>
        <ol>Sugar</ol>
        <ol>Milk</ol>
        <ol>Cinnamon</ol>
        <ol>Butter</ol>
        <ol>Salt</ol>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>Start by making the pie crust. You can either use a store-bought crust or make your own. If making your own crust, combine 2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a large bowl. Cut 1 cup of cold butter into small pieces and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 6-8 tablespoons of cold milk while stirring until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half, shape into disks, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. Peel, core, and slice about 6 Granny Smith apples into thin slices. In a separate bowl, combine 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Roll out one of the chilled dough disks on a floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Transfer the rolled-out dough to the pie dish, gently pressing it into the bottom and up the sides.</li>
        <li>Place the sliced apples into the prepared pie crust. Sprinkle the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt mixture over the apples. Dot the top with small pieces of butter (about 2 tablespoons).</li>
        <li>Roll out the second chilled dough disk and place it over the apple filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges of the crust to seal the pie.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>Optional: Brush the top crust with a little milk and sprinkle with sugar for a golden and slightly sweet finish.</li>
        <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving. This will help the filling set.</li>
    </ol>
